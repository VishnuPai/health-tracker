    ```

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy
- **Secure Auth**: Uses secure tokens via Firebase Authentication.

- **Role Protection**: Admin and Coach routes are protected by server-synced role checks.

## 👥 User Management & Workflows

### 1. Bootstrapping the First Admin
Since the app is secure by default, there is no public "Sign Up as Admin" page. To create the **First Admin**:
1.  Sign up as a regular user via the Register page.
2.  Go to the **Firebase Console** > **Firestore Database**.
3.  Find the `users` collection and locate your User ID document.
4.  Manually change the `role` field from `"user"` to `"admin"`.
5.  Refresh the app. You now have access to the **Admin Panel**.

### 2. Onboarding Coaches
1.  Ask the coach to sign up as a regular user.
2.  Log in as an **Admin**.
3.  Navigate to the **Admin Panel** (in Sidebar).
4.  Find the user in the list and click **"Promote to Coach"**.
5.  The user will instantly have access to the **Coach Dashboard**.

### 3. Client Management
- **Coaches** can view a read-only list of all users to track client goals.
- **Admins** have full control to modifications and role management.
- **Users** have strict data privacy and can only see their own personal health data.
